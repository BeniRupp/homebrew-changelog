[Homebrew] `changelog`
======================
Following on from [Homebrew/brew#3399], this is an effort to introduce a `changelog` _[stanza]_ into Home`brew` and `cask`.

Hopefully this will follow the process of the [`desc`]ription stanza, and so initially this will be in the from of an [external command], made available with a _[tap]_:
~~~ sh
brew tap danielbayley/changelog
brew changelog #formula
brew cask changelog #cask
~~~
