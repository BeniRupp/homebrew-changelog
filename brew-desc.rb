SYNOPSIS
    brew desc package-name1 package-name2 ...
    brew desc -s|--search string|regex
    brew desc [-h|-?|--help]

USAGE
    The command can be invoked in three ways:

    1. Get descriptions for one or more items you know the names of.
    2. Search for items based on a string or regex after -s or --search.
    3. Pass no arguments or -h, -?, or --help and get this usage message.

    Examples:

      brew desc mutt abook urlview   # Get descriptions for these three items
      brew desc --search mail        # Search descriptions for 'mail'
      brew desc -s 'ma(il|n)'        # Search descriptions for 'mail' or 'man'
EOF

if ARGV.size < 1 or ['-h', '-?', '--help'].include?(ARGV.first)
  puts usage
elsif  ARGV.first == '-s' or ARGV.first == '--search'
  candidates = descriptions.find_all do |k, v|
    v[/#{ARGV[1]}/i] || k[/#{ARGV[1]}/i]
  end

  candidates.sort! {|a,b| a[0] <=> b[0]}

  candidates.each do |name, desc|
    if desc == ""
      msg = "#{Tty.yellow}#{name}#{Tty.reset}: No description yet"
    else
      msg = "#{Tty.white}#{name}#{Tty.reset}: #{desc}"
    end

    puts msg
  end
else
  ARGV.formulae.each do |f|
    f = f.name

    #   Tty.<color> variables are defined in:
    #   HOMEBREW_LIBRARY_PATH/utils.rb
    #
    #   Note that many colors automatically come with
    #   styling like bold and underline, etc.  Check
    #   the definitions for details.
    if descriptions.key?(f)
      if descriptions[f].empty?
        puts <<-EOS.undent
          #{Tty.yellow}#{f}#{Tty.reset}: No description yet

          Please consider forking brew-desc and adding a description for
          this and other formulas. There's plenty of work to do still.

      else
        puts "#{Tty.white}#{f}#{Tty.reset}: #{descriptions[f]}"
      end
    else
      opoo <<-EOS.undent
        #{f} doesn't appear to be a formula from mxcl/master, which is all
        that `brew desc` supports at this point.

        If you think that #{f} is in mxcl/master, please file an issue at
        https://github.com/telemachus/homebrew-desc/issues and we'll check.
